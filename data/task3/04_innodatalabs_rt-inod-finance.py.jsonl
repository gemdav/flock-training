Applying the Miles and Snow (1978) typology, there are strong correlations between prospector (defender) firms and those in the introduction and decline (mature and shake out) stages of the life cycle. From a fundamental analysis perspective, prospector (defender) firms with, on average, higher (lower) profit margins and lower (higher) asset turnovers is more appealing as a theoretical predictor for how mean reversion in profitability operates than firm life cycle where there is no clear relation between the components of profitability across stages. A recent development to the forecasting literature is in the use of machine learning algorithms. Cao and You (2021) argue that machine learning techniques are able to overcome some limitations with the extant models to process financial statement information into forecasts more efficiently. Specifically, machine learning algorithms are able to handle high dimensional data, and they are able to accommodate more complex and subtle relationships between financial statement line items and future earnings. Any advantages, however, do come at the cost that more complex models are also more susceptible to in-sample overfitting that can lead to poor outof-sample performance (Cao and You 2021), and that there is often a lack of theory underlying the model.\u201d"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Argument was about Machine learing techniques, not about Human Intelligence learning techniques."}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "\"The annual financial report plays a significant role in assessing the company's performance and is a legal requirement. Even a seemingly simple report can become complex to prepare. Therefore, we are providing you with a step-by-step guide on how to prepare this crucial document.\n\nStep 1: Gather and Review Financial Data\nThe first and foremost step in preparing a detailed financial report is to collect and organize all financial data for the reporting period, including\n\nIncome statements\nBalance sheets\nCash flow statements\nRelevant Receipts\nSubsequently, it is crucial to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the financial data through a comprehensive review of these statements.\n\nFinally, a thorough examination of the financial data is essential to identify any evident trends, patterns, or areas of concern that may necessitate further insightful analysis or explanation.\n\nStep 2: Develop a Membership Forecast\nThe second step involves developing a membership forecast. To accomplish this, you need to create a detailed spreadsheet where you insert your membership records spanning the year, carefully tracking performance.\n\nThis spreadsheet should include different sections, such as members retained, new members acquired, and estimates for membership in the upcoming year. Additionally, incorporate a dedicated section detailing how much revenue was generated from members throughout the year.\n\nFurther enhance the analysis by breaking down revenue according to different membership plans, providing insights into the average spending of each member. This strategic approach ensures a subtle understanding of both membership dynamics and financial contributions, contributing to well-informed and precise membership projections.\n\nStep 3: Create a Budget for Expenses\nThe third step is paramount as it involves decoding the expenses. It is imperative to review historical expense data methodically to identify areas where costs can be controlled or reduced.\n\nThis process is instrumental in developing a detailed expense budget for each department or program. The budget should consist of all the details, including the sources of funding, major spending areas, and priorities for each department or program.\n\nFactors such as projected membership, operational needs, and strategic initiatives should be carefully considered during budgeting.\n\nThis strategic approach thoroughly examines expenses, facilitating informed decision-making and efficient cost management across various aspects of the organization.\n\n\nStep 4: Prepare Financial Statements\nThe fourth step is to generate the income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity for the reporting period. It is crucial to ensure that these financial statements are carefully prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or other applicable accounting frameworks.\n\nThis detailed preparation not only ensures accuracy and compliance but also promotes transparency for investors, partners, and the public.\n\nBy providing a clear and precise snapshot of the organization's financial performance and position, these statements contribute to building trust and understanding among stakeholders. According to the \"Enhancing Investors Trust Report 2022,\" 80% of retail investors aged 25\u201334 expressed trust in the completeness and accuracy of the information, highlighting financial statements' significant role in delivering confidence and informed decision-making.\n\n\nStep 5: Analyze and Interpret Financial Performance\nIn the subsequent step, calculate key financial metrics, including but not limited to revenue per member, expense per member, reserves-to-expenses ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio. This involves precisely examining the organization's financial landscape to derive meaningful insights.\n\nCompare these financial metrics to internal historical trends and industry benchmarks, enabling a comprehensive analysis of strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This strategic assessment provides valuable insights that guide decision-making and enhance the organization's overall financial health.\n\n\nStep 6: Write the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)\nIn the sixth step, furnish a narrative overview of the association's financial performance, stressing key trends, significant changes, and factors influencing the results.\n\nThis narrative should explore the association's strategic direction, address risks and uncertainties, and outline the future outlook. Providing a comprehensive report ensures a contextual understanding of the financial performance, offering stakeholders a fine-tuned perspective on the association's past, present, and future financial landscape.\nStep 7: Prepare the Letter to Members\nThe seventh step involves preparing personalized letters addressed directly to members. These letters briefly summarize the association's financial performance, accomplishments, and future plans.\n\nTake the opportunity to convey the association's overarching mission, values, and unwavering commitment to its members. The letters deliver a sense of connection and transparency by directly addressing members, ensuring members are well-informed about the association's financial standing and strategic vision.\n\n\nStep 8: Assemble the Annual Report\nFollowing that, your next task is to create a cover page that prominently features the association's name, logo, and reporting period. Integrate a user-friendly table of contents to facilitate easy navigation throughout the report.\n\nEnsure the inclusion of essential sections such as the letter to members, Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), financial statements, and any other pertinent information. Design the report with a clear and consistent layout, leveraging visuals and graphics strategically to enhance readability.\n\nThis diligent approach ensures a professional and organized presentation and contributes to a more engaging and informative annual financial report.\n\n\nStep 9: Review and Audit the Annual Report\nThe second last step involves conducting a demanding annual report review, examining it for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with applicable regulations. To ensure additional scrutiny, engage external auditors to review the financial statements independently and provide an audit opinion if required by association bylaws or regulations.\n\n\nThis dual review process not only validates the integrity of the financial information but also reinforces transparency and adherence to regulatory standards, instilling confidence among stakeholders in the reliability of the annual report.\n\n\nStep 10: Distribute the Annual Report\nThe final step in the process is to distribute the annual report to members, potential members, stakeholders, and other interested parties.\n\nThis distribution ensures that relevant individuals and entities have access to the comprehensive information encapsulated in the annual report, fostering transparency and keeping all concerned parties well-informed about the association's financial performance and strategic outlook.\n\nThis step is critical for maintaining open communication, building trust, and promoting a shared understanding of the association's achievements and future plans\"\n\nSummarize and tell is the annual financial report just for members of the organisation?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The annual financial report is not solely for members of the organization."}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}

I would encourage you to read through the entire message in the Annual Report.\n\nMoving ahead, the next section is the \u2018Management Discussion & Analysis\u2019 or \u2018MD&A\u2019. This, in my opinion, is perhaps one of the most important sections in the whole of AR. The most standard way for any company to start this section is by talking about the macro trends in the economy. They discuss the overall economic activity of the country and the business sentiment across the corporate world. If the company has high exposure to exports, they even talk about global economic and business sentiment.\n\nARBL has both exports and domestic business interest; hence they discuss both these angles in their AR.Following this, the companies usually talk about industry trends and what they expect for the year ahead. This is an important section as we can understand what the company perceives as threats and opportunities in the industry. Most importantly, I read through this and compare it with its peers to understand if the company has an advantage over its peers.\n\nFor example, if Amara Raja Batteries Limited is a company of interest, I would read through this part of the AR and read through what Exide Batteries Limited has to say in their AR.\n\nRemember, until this point, the discussion in the Management Discussion & Analysis is broad-based and generic (global economy, domestic economy, and industry trends). However, in the future, the company would discuss various aspects related to its business. It talks about how the business had performed across various divisions, how it fares compared to the previous year, etc. The company, in fact, gives out specific numbers in this section.\n\nAfter discussing these in \u2018Management Discussion & Analysis,\u2019 the annual report includes a series of other reports such as \u2013 Human Resources report, R&D report, Technology report etc. Each of these reports is important in the context of the industry the company operates in. For example, if I am reading through a manufacturing company annual report, I would be particularly interested in the human resources report to understand if the company has any labour issues. If there are serious signs of labour issues, it could lead to the factory being shut down, which is not good for its shareholders.\n\nFinally, the last section of the AR contains the financial statements of the company. As you would agree, the financial statements are perhaps one of the most important aspects of an Annual Report. There are three financial statements that the company will present namely:\n\nThe Profit and Loss statement\nThe Balance Sheet and\nThe Cash flow statement\nWe will understand each of these statements in detail over the next few chapters. However, it is important to understand that the financial statements come in two forms at this stage.\n\nStandalone financial statement or simply standalone numbers and\nConsolidated financial statement or simply consolidated numbers\nTo understand the difference between standalone and consolidated numbers, we need to understand a company\u2019s structure.\n\nTypically, a well-established company has many subsidiaries. These companies also act as a holding company for several other well-established companies. To help you understand this better, I have taken the example of CRISIL Limited\u2019s shareholding structure. You can find the same in CRISIL\u2019s annual report. As you may know, CRISIL is an Indian company with a major focus on corporate credit rating services.\n\nWhich section of the annual report does the author believe to be the most important?\n\nA) Financial Highlights.\n\nB) Notice.\n\nC) Profit & Loss Statement\n\nD) Human Resources Report\n\nE) None of the Above"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "E) None of the Above"}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}

These companies also act as a holding company for several other well-established companies. To help you understand this better, I have taken the example of CRISIL Limited\u2019s shareholding structure. You can find the same in CRISIL\u2019s annual report. As you may know, CRISIL is an Indian company with a major focus on corporate credit rating services.\n\nAs you can see in the above shareholding structure:\n\nStandard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), a US-based rating agency holds a 51% stake in CRISIL. Hence S&P is the \u2018Holding company\u2019 or the \u2018Promoter\u2019 of CRISIL.\nPublic and other Financial institutions hold the balance of 49% of shares of CRISIL.\nHowever, S&P itself is 100% subsidiary of another company called \u2018The McGraw-Hill Companies\u2019\nThis means McGraw Hill fully owns S&P, and S&P owns 51% of CRISIL.\nFurther, CRISIL itself fully owns (100% shareholding) another company called \u2018Irevna\u2019.\nKeeping the above in perspective, think about this hypothetical situation. Assume, for the financial year 2014, CRISIL makes a loss of Rs.1000 Crs and Irevna, its 100% subsidiary makes a profit of Rs.700 Crs. What do you would be the overall profitability of CRISIL?\n\nWell, this is quite simple \u2013 CRISIL on its own made a loss of Rs.1000 Crs, but its subsidiary Irevna made a profit of Rs.700 Crs, hence the overall P&L of CRISIL is (Rs.1000 Crs) + Rs.700 Crs = (Rs.300 Crs).\n\nThanks to its subsidiary, CRISIL\u2019s loss is reduced to Rs.300 Crs instead of a massive loss of Rs.1000 Crs. Another way to look at it is that CRISIL on a standalone basis made a loss of Rs.1000 Crs, but on a consolidated basis, it made a loss of Rs.300 Crs.\n\nHence, Standalone Financial statements represent the company\u2019s standalone numbers/ financials and do not include its subsidiaries\u2019 financials. However, the consolidated numbers include the companies (i.e.standalone financials) and its subsidiaries financial statements.\n\nI personally prefer to look through the consolidated financial statements to represent the company\u2019s financial position better.\n\n3.4 \u2013 Schedules of Financial Statements\nWhen the company reports its financial statements, they usually report the full statement and then follow it up with a detailed explanation.\nEach particular in the financial statement is referred to as the line item. For example, the first line item in the Balance Sheet (under Equity and Liability) is the share capital (as pointed out by the green arrow). If you notice, there is a note number associated with share capital. These are called the \u2018Schedules\u2019 related to the financial statement. Looking into the above statement, ARBL states that the share capital stands at Rs.17.081 Crs (or Rs.170.81 Million). As an investor, I would obviously be interested in knowing how ARBL arrived at Rs.17.081 Crs as their share capital. Of course, considering you may be new to financial statements, jargon like share capital makes much sense. However, the financial statements are straightforward to understand, and over the next few chapters, you will understand how to read the financial statements and make sense of it. But for now, remember that the main financial statement gives you the summary and the associated schedules give the details about each line item.\nAs per this passage, list down the 4 financial statements that the company presents in the last section?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are three financial statements that the company presents in the last section."}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}

It also includes broader measures of income and savings adjusted for pollution, depreciation, and depletion of resources.

These indicators reflect those changes to track if the economy is growing or contracting over time.\n\nInvestors focus on these determinants to decide whether it is a good time to invest. The economic data comes from multiple reliable sources, helping analysts understand where a nation\u2019s economy is moving. While the System of National Accounts (SNA) has an integrated system of accounts that allows users to compare economic activities and progress per international standards, the Balance of Payments (BOP) keeps a check on the overseas transactions of an economy. In addition, Government Finance Statistics deals with the income and expenditure records with the Monetary and Financial Statistics, providing a compilation guide.\n\nThe macro economic indicators that help analysts evaluate the economic condition of a nation include the Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP), the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index (PPI), unemployment, the stock market, crude oil prices, interest rates, Balance of Trade, currency strength, etc. These indicators not only give a clue about the growing or contracting economy of a nation but also indicate the extent to which the global economy would be affected.\n\nThe key economic indicators of development help assess the pace of growth of an economy. In addition, they indicate the contraction rate if the growth is in the negative direction. If the determinants reflect the future changes, it helps investors decide if it\u2019s the right time to select a security to invest in or take a trade.\n\nOn the other hand, if the indicators run parallelly, they allow analysts to make preparations before the situation worsens. However, sometimes, they indicate the changes that have already occurred in the economy. In that case, the information helps track and identify specific patterns so that the economy remains prepared for the next time such events occur.\n\nLet us understand the most important micro and macro economic indicators.These depict the health, performance, and stability of an economy. Let us understand them through the explanation below.\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP): Measures the total value of goods and services produced within a country\u2019s borders, indicating the overall health of the economy.\nUnemployment Rate: Reflects the percentage of the labor force actively seeking employment but currently unemployed, serving as a key indicator of job market conditions.\nInflation Rate: Tracks the percentage increase in the general price level of goods and services over time, impacting consumer purchasing power and overall economic stability.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI): Measures changes in the average prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods and services, providing insight into inflation trends.\nRetail Sales: Indicates the total revenue of retail establishments, serving as a gauge of consumer spending patterns and economic activity.\nStock Market Indices: Benchmarks like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average offer insights into overall market sentiment and investor confidence.\nExamine the significant impact that important economic indicators\u2014such as the GDP, retail sales, CPI, unemployment rate, inflation rate, and stock market indices\u2014have on investing choices and how they might reveal information about the general health and stability of a given economy.\nName the three types of key economic indicators based on the passage."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Not given."}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}

Most of India\u2019s economic data is based on numbers collected more than a decade ago, when smartphones were rare and apps like Uber or Zomato hadn\u2019t yet revolutionized the way Indians travel, eat and shop.\nThis means the consumer price index \u2014 which is used by the central bank to set borrowing costs \u2014 doesn\u2019t fully capture the texture of modern India. The statistics ministry still collects sales data for near-obsolete items like audio cassettes, making it difficult for market watchers to measure the true strength of the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and form a nuanced picture about its demographics and consumption habits.\n\u201cWe have programs for people below the poverty line, but we don\u2019t know the number of poor people,\u201d said Pronab Sen, India\u2019s former chief statistician.\n\nIt\u2019s an alarming problem for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who\u2019s pitching India as the next big market for global investment and trade.

In another example, Indians spend less than 30% on food, though that metric comprises about half of the CPI basket.\n\n\u201cWhat we cannot measure we cannot manage,\u201d Chief Statistician G.P.

But the survey won\u2019t feed into GDP or CPI metrics for at least two years, forcing analysts to use alternative indicators like air traffic and fuel demand to check the pulse of India\u2019s economy.\n\nTo more accurately estimate GDP, the government has also made a list of 200 critical data sources, according to people familiar with the matter. The list includes goods and services tax collections, company filings and e-way bills for interstate movement of goods. India\u2019s statistics ministry is pressing other government departments to share information in a timely manner to reduce lags in data reporting, the people said, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private.\n\nThe statistics ministry didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe issue is not limited to outdated numbers. Frequent revisions to existing data have added to frustrations, making it difficult to predict where one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies is headed \u2014 and raising accusations among India\u2019s political opposition that the numbers have been tampered with.\n\nData revisions in recent years made India\u2019s growth appear impressive during a devastating cash ban.

The\nSBJ implemented a hedonic model using scanner data\nto measure price change of personal computers in 2000\nand of digital cameras in 2003. Price indices of TV and\nmobile phones using scanner data were among the\nmore recent trial calculations.7\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has been\nseeking ways to utilize big data for compilation of\neconomic statistics since 2011. It undertook extensive\ntesting and experimentation before introducing scanner\ndata in the production of the official CPI in a phased\napproach in 2014. Scanner data from retail transactions\ncurrently accounts for over 25% of the weight of the\nConsumer Price Index.\n\nStatistics New Zealand (Stats NZ) started developing\nmethods for measuring price change for goods and\nservices using scanner data in 2011. Among the first\ncategories considered were consumer electronic goods\nas they experience significant technological changes\nover a short period of time, which is challenging to\nmeasure with traditional data methods. By 2014, Stats\nNZ implemented scanner data for a range of consumer\nelectronic products into the official CPI.\ncollection to electronic data transmission by retail\nnetworks. Together with item descriptions, price and\nquantity data, supermarket chains provide\ncorresponding internal classification of items, which is\nthen used by Geostat to create an EAN (International\nArticle Number) \u2013 COICOP (Classification of\nIndividual Consumption According to Purpose)\nconvertor. The convertor is updated every month after\ndata transition. Geostat is considering extending the\npartnership to other supermarkets.\nThe Federal State Statistics Service of the Russian\nFederation (Rosstat) has also been exploring\nalternative data sources for compiling consumer price\nstatistics. By 2018, Rosstat had been negotiating for\nseveral years with various owners of prices data, both\nin the private sector and the government, on the\npossible use of their information to compile the CPI.10\nRosstat concluded agreements with several retailers for\nobtaining scanner data. However, the codification of\nproducts in the receipts varies across the systems of\ndifferent retailers and Rosstat is currently exploring\nhow Artificial Intelligence can address this issue.\nFurthermore, Rosstat has also attempted to access the\npoint of sale (POS), which the Federal Tax Service\ncollects online from economic agents across the\ncountry. However, obtaining access to the same data\ncollected by the Federal Tax Service from retailers\nwould require changes to the legislation.\nThe abovementioned statistical offices gained access to\ndata in different ways. The ABS and Geostat obtained\nscanner data directly from the retailers, which required\nbuilding a good relationship with them and assuring\nconfidentiality through a memorandum of\nunderstanding. The SBJ and Stats NZ, on the other\nhand, started by acquiring data from market research\ncompanies. Several other NSOs have also tried to\nnegotiate access to scanner data with retail networks but are currently limiting their experimentation to web\nscraped data.\n1.2 Compiling CPI using online price data\nStatistical offices in the region are progressively\nexploring web scraping of online price data to produce\nCPI.\nSince 2017, the ABS has been incorporating web\nscraped data in the production of CPI in sub-indexes\nfor clothing11, hardware, alcoholic beverages, and\nsmall appliances.12 In late 2018, the ABS began\nresearch into using automated methods to process web\nscraped data for clothing and footwear products. The\nABS estimates there is the potential to use web scraped\ndata for up to 20-25 per cent of the CPI.13 The ABS\nconducts online data scraping in-house to retain control\nof the process.\nStats NZ has been conducting online data collection\ntrials since 2017, concluding that more data was\navailable for goods than for services.14 As a trial, Stats\nNZ also created a digital Food Price Index from webscraped data from two supermarket chains.\n15 The main\nissue was the chain drift in an unweighted series. Since\nthen, Stats NZ has been approaching supermarket\nchains directly, to negotiate the supply of data. Stats\nNZ has been using a mix of obtaining web-scraped data\nfrom third-party providers, as well as developing its\nown in-house capacity.\nSBJ examined the calculation of airplane fares by using\nweb-scraped data obtained from a third-party data\nprovider. Data of all the flights in each route (price, departure date, route, etc.) were collected every day\nfrom the reservation websites of the major Japanese\nairline companies. Prices for the same airline tickets\nwere collected for three time-intervals to register\ndifferent discount rates.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Economic indicators come in multiple groups or categories. Most economic indicators come with a specific schedule for release and can be helpful in the right circumstance. Here are the three important types of economic indicators that we can group most into.\n\nLeading Indicators: Leading indicators point to future changes in the economy. They are extremely useful for short-term predictions of economic developments because they usually change before the economy changes.\nLagging Indicators: Lagging indicators usually come after the economy changes. They are generally most helpful when used to confirm specific patterns. You can make economic predictions based on the patterns, but lagging indicators cannot be used to directly predict economic change.\nCoincident Indicators: Coincident indicators provide valuable information about the current state of the economy within a particular area because they happen at the same time as the changes they signal.\nTop Economic Indicators and How They\u2019re Used\nThere are several economic indicators that are grouped into the three types listed above. Each one can help investors, economists and financial analysts make smart financial decisions. Below we cover some of the most important indicators that you might find helpful, depending on what you\u2019re wanting to predict or plan for.\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP)\nGDP is a lagging indicator. It is one of the first indicators used to gauge the health of an economy. It represents economic production and growth, or the size of the economy. Measuring GDP can be complicated, but there are two basic ways to measure it.\n\nOne measurement is the income approach. This approach adds up what everyone earned in a year, including gross profits for non-incorporated and incorporated firms, taxes less any subsidies and total compensation to employees. The other approach is the expenditure method. This method adds up what everyone spent in a year, including total consumption, government spending, net exports and investments. The results of these two measurements should be roughly the same. However, the expenditure method is the more common approach because it includes consumer spending, which accounts for the majority of a country\u2019s GDP.\n\nGDP is usually expressed in comparison to the previous quarter or year. For example, if the GDP of a country is up 2% in 2018, the economy of that country has grown 2% since the previous measurement of GDP in 2017. Annual GDP figures are often considered the best indicators of the size of the economy. Economists use two different types of GDP when measuring a country\u2019s economy. Real GDP is adjusted for inflation, while nominal GDP is not adjusted for inflation.\n\nAn increase in GDP indicates that businesses are making more money. It also suggests an increase in the standard of living for people in that country. If GDP decreases, then it suggests the reverse. The market\u2019s responses to GDP shifts may also depend upon how one quarterly GDP measure compares to prior quarters, as well as how it compares to economists\u2019 expectations for that current quarter.\nThe stock market is a leading indicator. It\u2019s also the indicator that most people look to first, even though it\u2019s not the most important indicator.\n\nStock prices are partially based on what companies are expected to earn. If companies\u2019 earnings estimates are accurate, the stock market can indicate the economy\u2019s direction. For example, a down market could indicate that overall company earnings are expected to decrease and the economy could be headed toward a recession. On the other hand, an upmarket could suggest that earnings estimates are up and therefore the economy as a whole may be thriving.\n\nThe stock market is not necessarily an accurate leading indicator. Earning estimates could be wrong, and the stock market is vulnerable to manipulation. Wall Street corporations and traders can manipulate numbers to inflate stocks via complex financial derivative strategies, high-volume trades and creative accounting principles. (Wall Street\u2019s version of creative accounting is not always legal.)\n\nIn addition, the government and Federal Reserve have used federal stimulus money and other strategies to keep markets high in order to avoid public panic in the event of an economic crisis. Since the market is vulnerable to manipulation, a stock or index price is not necessarily an accurate reflection of its value.\n\nThere are also stock market bubbles, which can give a false positive for the economy\u2019s direction. If investors ignore underlying economic indicators, and there are unsupported increases in price levels, a market crash could happen. We saw this when the market crashed in 2008 as a result of overvalued credit default swaps and subprime loans.\nCan you unravel the secret of GDP?

The policies stress that the Company will not directly or indirectly solicit, offer, promise, authorize, provide, or accept anything of value to any person, including government officials, to influence action, inaction, or to secure an improper advantage as defined by applicable laws. To help employees understand these requirements, training on anti-bribery and corruption is provided. In FY 2022/23, 97 percent of the Company\u2019s computer-based employees completed the assigned anti-bribery and corruption mandatory eLearning course. In addition, 21 facilitator-led sessions focused on anti-bribery and corruption basics and case studies were provided to over 11,000 China-based employees of the Company. The Company also provides Code training to new employees, which includes anti-bribery and corruption topics. The Board of Directors and Senior Leadership Team are provided a facilitator-led training session on anti-bribery and corruption. Bribery and corruption risks are also evaluated as part of the Company\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management Program risk assessment to ensure the Company\u2019s internal controls effectively address and mitigate bribery and corruption risk to the enterprise. In FY 2022/23, the Company received the result of one concluded legal case regarding corruption that the Company had previously transferred to authorities. The involved person was sentenced with one year imprisonment, a two-year probation, and a RMB30,000 fine for receiving RMB280,000 in kickbacks in exchange for providing improper benefits to a business partner. The Company terminated employment with the involved person. In addition, the Company has undertaken additional internal control measures to prevent similar incidents. The impact of the case to the Company\u2019s business was minor. Anti-competitive practices and fair competition The Company competes for business ethically and lawfully. The Code and Policy on anti-competitive practices and fair competition prohibit employees from engaging in anti-competitive practices, such as entering into an agreement or discussion that would result in price-fixing, limitations on the availability of goods or services on the market, or agreements to boycott a customer or supplier.

The Company expects its employees to protect its intellectual property and respect the intellectual property rights of other companies and individuals. Intellectual property rights include patents, copyrights, trademarks, confidential information, and related contract rights. The Company secures its own intellectual property using these and other applicable forms of legal protection. Therefore, the Company\u2019s employees must each sign and abide by their agreement with the Company regarding confidential information and intellectual property. The Company also expects its employees to contribute to the Company\u2019s innovation leadership. To this end, the Company\u2019s employees should submit their inventions and ideas to the Company\u2019s patent review board for prompt review and protection with the support of the Intellectual Property Law Department. The Company respects the intellectual property rights of other companies and individuals, including their proprietary materials, confidential information, software, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets. Employees should work with the Company\u2019s counsel in the Legal Department as appropriate to ensure all necessary rights and licenses are obtained before utilizing any non-Lenovo proprietary materials. Privacy and data protection The Company maintains a Global Privacy and Data Protection Program, which leads the organization\u2019s commitment to responsibly using and protecting customer, consumer, employee and partner identifiable information. The Lenovo Global Privacy and Data Protection Program develops and maintains policies, processes, training, and other mechanisms and resources to ensure that the Company is in compliance with global privacy and related data protection laws and regulations.

The Company\u2019s supply base is comprised of the\nfollowing categories: internal manufacturing centers,\nproduction procurement, original design\nmanufacturers (ODM), and general procurement.\nProduction procurement includes all suppliers that\nprovide materials or components that become part of\nthe Company\u2019s products. ODMs include manufacturing\npartners who manufacture products on behalf of the\nCompany. General procurement includes all suppliers\nthat provide materials and products which support\nthe Company\u2019s operations but do not become part of\nits products.\nThe Company\u2019s supply base is comprised of multiple\ntiers in which lower tiers of suppliers provide materials\nand parts to higher tiers \u2013 and eventually to its Tier 1\nsuppliers, the suppliers with whom the Company has a\ndirect contractual relationship.\nThe disclosures in this report apply to the Company\u2019s\nproduction procurement supplier base. The majority\nof the Company\u2019s spend is with production\nprocurement suppliers which often have ESG impacts\nand risks. Production procurement suppliers can have\nsocial risks because they require substantial labor\nforces and have access to large, lower-skilled labor\npools that may be vulnerable to exploitation.\nProduction procurement suppliers may generally also\nhave environmental impacts through the energy,\nwater, and materials required for production.\nDistribution of suppliers\nThe Company recognizes that there can be many\nbenefits in utilizing local suppliers, including\ndecreased logistics costs, potentially lower GHG\nemissions, the opportunity to support local\neconomies, and maintaining community relationships.\nThe Company considers local suppliers as those that\noperate in the same country as its significant locations\nof operations. In FY 2022/23, its significant locations\nof operations included manufacturing locations in\nChina, US, Mexico, Brazil, Hungary, Japan, and India.\nThe Company estimates that 90 percent of\nproduction supply spend in China is with local\nsuppliers. In other manufacturing geographies, the\nCompany estimates that 20 percent of spend is with\nlocal suppliers.\nESG in the supply chain\nThe Company considers the supply chain a vital part\nof its operations and views effective supply chain\nmanagement as an important contributor to its\nsuccess. Given this, the Company has many controls\nand programs in place to manage its overall\nprocurement process. The Company recognizes that\nESG risks and impacts exist among its suppliers which\nmay differ from the ESG impacts and risks associated\nwith the Company\u2019s own operations. To better\nmanage these risks, the Company has integrated\nseveral ESG-specific controls and practices into its\nMaster Procurement Process.\nMaster procurement process\nThe Company\u2019s Master Procurement Process is\ndesigned to oversee all purchase commitments for\nproduction materials and the goods and services that\nsupport its worldwide operations. With a mission to\ndeliver the best pricing, quality, supply, technology,\nand service in a sustainable manner, this model\nprovides a controlled procurement approach that is\napplied across the organization for commodities and\nincludes the following elements for production and\ngeneral procurement:\nDelegation of authority\nThe Company\u2019s Code of Conduct includes\nrequirements for the formal delegation which support\naccountability and responsible procurement practices.\nThe \u2018Authority to Make Lenovo Commitments\u2019 section\noutlines the requirements for delegations with defined\nauthority for commitments and other contract terms\nand conditions and, most importantly, that making\nbusiness commitments outside these processes is not\nPermitted.\nSupplier selection\nImplementing a controlled approach to awarding the\nCompany\u2019s business to suppliers is critical to meet its\nprocurement objectives and to establish a trusted\nbase of suppliers. Therefore, even the perception of\nfavoritism or bias is unacceptable. To ensure business\nawards are conducted ethically and fairly, the\nCompany has defined and approved sourcing\nmethods to ensure the following:\n\u2022 Suppliers have a fair opportunity to compete\nfor the Company\u2019s business\n\u2022 Buyers conduct an ethical evaluation on\ncarefully understood facts such as supplier\nprices, terms, and conditions\n\u2022 The most capable suppliers are selected based\non the best overall acquisition value\n\u2022 Business awards are reviewed and approved\nwith proper delegation of authority.\nNew supplier validation\nNew suppliers are assessed for numerous capabilities\nincluding their operational aspects, financial stability,\nproduct or information security, and ESG\nexpectations. More specifically, all new production\nsuppliers are assessed on their sustainability policies,\ncodes of conduct, ISO certifications, ESG standards,\nenvironmental impact aspects, controls to prevent\nforced labor, and public reporting. Of particular\nconcern are suppliers that may be listed as restricted\nor denied parties identified by governments and/or\ninternational agencies.

Almost 75 percent organisations stated that their investors rate their ESG performance. As indicated by 71 percent organisations, voluntary participation in ESG ratings is also a growing trend.

Less than half, only 49\npercent surveyed organisations reported a thorough understanding of ESG reporting mechanisms and regulations in India, signalling the need for urgent attention. On a brighter note, 68 percent organisations have made significant progress by formally integrating ESG strategies and mechanisms into their operations. Although 83 percent organisations have designated sustainability leaders, only one-third have both internal ESG champions and sustainability leaders, indicating room for enhancing internal ESG leadership.\n\nOn ESG reporting, 80 percent organisations actively reporting their ESG efforts, with sustainability reports leading the way (81 percent), followed by ESG reports (50 percent), and Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) and integrated reports (44 percent).

CFOs at US-listed companies mentioned the topics on 93 calls from 1 April to 5 June, down 30 percent from the prior-year period, per the Washington Post.\n\nWho are they afraid of?\n\nThey have probably done so, as opposition against the \u201cweaponisation of capital\u201d (aka ESG) has risen from well-funded right-wing organisations. These organisations have formed a powerful lobby, transmitting the message deep into Republican-governed states that ESG is wrecking social norms and dooming fossil-fuel production, on which many rely for jobs and tax revenue.\n\nThis year alone, the Economist said on 27 July, Republican lawmakers in 37 states have proposed at least 167 laws targeting ESG. Most have not passed. Republican-led Texas set a precedent, when in August 2022, BlackRock became the first American company to be put on a blacklist. This barred the state\u2019s public institutions from investing money with asset managers that \u201cboycotted\u201d energy companies. Other states have followed Texas\u2019 example.\n\nGet out of politics\n\nBy going radio silent on their ESG targets, firms have laid themselves open to accusations of backpedalling. During Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, corporate leaders turned into political CEOs, sticking their necks out on hot-button issues. They loudly embraced ESG-infused stakeholder capitalism, hoping to attract consumers and workers.\n\nThen came the \u201cwokelash\u201d. Disney\u2019s tug of war with Mr DeSantis over his \u201cDon't Say Gay\u201d bill in March 2022, which prohibits Florida teachers from discussing sexual and gender identity in some primary-school year groups, cost Disney\u2019s CEO Mr Chapek his job. The affair marked a fork in the road. The lesson of the wokelash is that outspokenness can backfire, The Economist said.\n\nGo green, go dark\n\nIt is understandable that by going silent, companies hope they will avoid political flak. But critics, like the Swiss consultancy South Pole, complain that greenhushing makes corporate sustainability targets harder to scrutinise, potentially leading to less ambitious targets being set, and missed opportunities for industries to collaborate.\n\nHowever, there is little evidence yet of large companies backing off their sustainability commitments. For example, in 2021, AB-InBev signed a USD 10.1 billion ESG-linked loan. The facility has an initial five-year term and will cost more to service if the company falls short of its 2025 sustainability goals. One year later, Fernando Tennenbaum, CFO at AB-InBev told Fortune, a magazine: \u201cPart of my compensation, part of my bonus is linked to ESG.\u201d As AB-InBev\u2019s case underlines, the ESG or sustainability agenda has been firmly embedded in corporate strategies.\n\nNo one knows if greenhushing will have the same staying power as greenwashing. Given the toxic culture wars, the threats of tarnished reputations and legal trouble, companies will have to make a calculated decision on what to share, how to share it and how much to share at each turn.\n\nAccording to the passage, what is the opposite of \"greenwashing?\"\n\na) Greenhushing\nb) Green innovation\nc) Sustainable development\nd) Eco-friendly marketing"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "a) Greenhushing"}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}

But then there are financial institutions that have made it possible. Yes, it is hard to believe, but some lenders have a completely digital process that works instantly.       \n\nAn instant money loan is a Personal Loan made available almost instantly to help with numerous financial needs. This is one of the most convenient and swift ways to arrange for funds when needed unexpectedly as well as for planned expenses.\n\n\nYou can use an instant money loan for various things, such as renovating or remodelling your home, buying a cool gadget you have always eyed, planning your dream wedding, or making some memories on that dream vacation. It is one of the best ways to help you through tricky times, like a medical emergency, sudden job loss or other unforeseen expenses. It is the ideal way to take care of your immediate cash requirements without dipping into your savings. Today, you can avail of an instant loan online without much hassle. \n\nWith some new-age lenders offering loans and free financial tools, such as an EMI calculator, getting an instant loan online takes minutes. And if you have done your homework and researched a little, you may also be able to avail these instant money loans at surprisingly low-interest rates. However, many factors and circumstances influence the rate of interest; be aware of the same and work towards improving them to get more favourable interest rates. \nSteps to get an instant money loan at surprisingly low-interest rates:\n\n1. Be clear about Your Financial Standing and Requirement \nBefore finalising a Personal Loan with a lender, you must be clear about your income and outflow. New-age lenders offer online financial tools such as the eligibility calculator and loan EMI calculator. This is the best way to get a clear picture of the rate of interest that will be levied and how much you will have to repay each month. Choose an amount you are comfortable with and work backwards to fix a particular loan amount. You can play around with this financial tool and choose a flexible EMI repayment tenure, amount, and interest to best suit you. \n2. Ensure you have a Good Credit Score \nThe higher your credit score and past repayment trends, the lower will be your interest rate.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Financial statements (or financial reports) are formal records of the financial activities and position of a business, person, or other entity.\n\nRelevant financial information is presented in a structured manner and in a form which is easy to understand. They typically include four basic financial statements accompanied by a management discussion and analysis:\n\nA balance sheet or statement of financial position, reports on a company's assets, liabilities, and owners equity at a given point in time.\nAn income statement\u2014or profit and loss report (P&L report), or statement of comprehensive income, or statement of revenue & expense\u2014reports on a company's income, expenses, and profits over a stated period. A profit and loss statement provides information on the operation of the enterprise. These include sales and the various expenses incurred during the stated period.\nA statement of changes in equity or statement of equity, or statement of retained earnings, reports on the changes in equity of the company over a stated period.\nA cash flow statement reports on a company's cash flow activities, particularly its operating, investing and financing activities over a stated period.\nNotably, a balance sheet represents a single point in time, whereas the income statement, the statement of changes in equity, and the cash flow statement each represent activities over a stated period.\n\nFor large corporations, these statements may be complex and may include an extensive set of footnotes to the financial statements and management discussion and analysis. The notes typically describe each item on the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement in further detail. Notes to financial statements are considered an integral part of the financial statements.\n\nPurpose for financial statements\n\"The objective of financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, performance and changes in financial position of an enterprise that is useful to a wide range of users in making economic decisions.\" Financial statements should be understandable, relevant, reliable and comparable. Reported assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses are directly related to an organization's financial position.\n\nFinancial statements are intended to be understandable by readers who have \"a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and accounting and who are willing to study the information diligently. \"Financial statements may be used by users for different purposes:\n\nOwners and managers require financial statements to make important business decisions that affect its continued operations. Financial analysis is then performed on these statements to provide management with a more detailed understanding of the figures. These statements are also used as part of management's annual report to the stockholders.\nEmployees also need these reports in making collective bargaining agreements (CBA) with the management, in the case of labor unions or for individuals in discussing their compensation, promotion and rankings.\nProspective investors make use of financial statements to assess the viability of investing in a business. Financial analyses are often used by investors and are prepared by professionals (financial analysts), thus providing them with the basis for making investment decisions.\nFinancial institutions (banks and other lending companies) use them to decide whether to grant a company with fresh working capital or extend debt securities (such as a long-term bank loan or debentures) to finance expansion and other significant expenditures.\nStockholders may from time to time request insight into how share capital is managed, which may be made available via financial statements (or stock statements), as it lies in the financial interest of shareowners in affirming that capital stock is handled viably and mindfully with duly care.\nHow do financial statements serve as comprehensive tools for users by offering structured insights into an entity's financial activities and position?\n\nRead the passage to answer: Which four fundamental financial statements are usually found in the financial reports of a company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Financial statements give owners, investors, and financial institutions a structured summary of an entity's financial activity, assisting them in making well-informed decisions.\n\nBalance sheet, income statement, statement of changes in equity, and cash flow statement."}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Consolidated financial statements are defined as \"Financial statements of a group in which the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent (company) and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity\", according to International Accounting Standard 27 \"Consolidated and separate financial statements\", and International Financial Reporting Standard 10 \"Consolidated financial statements\".[4][5]\n\nGovernment\nSee also: Fund accounting\nThe rules for the recording, measurement and presentation of government financial statements may be different from those required for business and even for non-profit organizations. They may use either of two accounting methods: accrual accounting, or cost accounting, or a combination of the two (OCBOA). A complete set of chart of accounts is also used that is substantially different from the chart of a profit-oriented business.\n\nPersonal\nPersonal financial statements may be required from persons applying for a personal loan or financial aid. Typically, a personal financial statement consists of a single form for reporting personally held assets and liabilities (debts), or personal sources of income and expenses, or both. The form to be filled out is determined by the organization supplying the loan or aid.\n\nAudit and legal implications\nAlthough laws differ from country to country, an audit of the financial statements of a public company is usually required for investment, financing, and tax purposes. These are usually performed by independent accountants or auditing firms. Results of the audit are summarized in an audit report that either provide an unqualified opinion on the financial statements or qualifications as to its fairness and accuracy. The audit opinion on the financial statements is usually included in the annual report.\n\nThere has been much legal debate over who an auditor is liable to. Since audit reports tend to be addressed to the current shareholders, it is commonly thought that they owe a legal duty of care to them. But this may not be the case as determined by common law precedent. In Canada, auditors are liable only to investors using a prospectus to buy shares in the primary market. In the United Kingdom, they have been held liable to potential investors when the auditor was aware of the potential investor and how they would use the information in the financial statements. Nowadays auditors tend to include in their report liability restricting language, discouraging anyone other than the addressees of their report from relying on it. Liability is an important issue: in the UK, for example, auditors have unlimited liability.\n\nIn the United States, especially in the post-Enron era there has been substantial concern about the accuracy of financial statements. Corporate officers\u2014the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO)\u2014are personally responsible for fair financial reporting that provides an accurate sense of the organization to those reading the report.\n\nStandards and regulations\nDifferent countries have developed their own accounting principles over time, making international comparisons of companies difficult. To ensure uniformity and comparability between financial statements prepared by different companies, a set of guidelines and rules are used. Commonly referred to as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these set of guidelines provide the basis in the preparation of financial statements, although many companies voluntarily disclose information beyond the scope of such requirements.[6]\n\nRecently there has been a push towards standardizing accounting rules made by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IASB develops International Financial Reporting Standards that have been adopted by Australia, Canada and the European Union (for publicly quoted companies only), are under consideration in South Africa and other countries. The United States Financial Accounting Standards Board has made a commitment to converge the U.S. GAAP and IFRS over time.\n\nInclusion in annual reports\nTo entice new investors, public companies assemble their financial statements on fine paper with pleasing graphics and photos in an annual report to shareholders, attempting to capture the excitement and culture of the organization in a \"marketing brochure\" of sorts.

To ensure uniformity and comparability between financial statements prepared by different companies, a set of guidelines and rules are used. Commonly referred to as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these set of guidelines provide the basis in the preparation of financial statements, although many companies voluntarily disclose information beyond the scope of such requirements.[6]\n\nRecently there has been a push towards standardizing accounting rules made by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IASB develops International Financial Reporting Standards that have been adopted by Australia, Canada and the European Union (for publicly quoted companies only), are under consideration in South Africa and other countries. The United States Financial Accounting Standards Board has made a commitment to converge the U.S. GAAP and IFRS over time.\n\nInclusion in annual reports\nTo entice new investors, public companies assemble their financial statements on fine paper with pleasing graphics and photos in an annual report to shareholders, attempting to capture the excitement and culture of the organization in a \"marketing brochure\" of sorts.

The purpose of the MD&A is to provide a narrative explanation, through the eyes of management, of how an entity has performed in the past, its financial condition, and its future prospects. In so doing, the MD&A attempt to provide investors with complete, fair, and balanced information to help them decide whether to invest or continue to invest in an entity.[7]\n\nThe section contains a description of the year gone by and some of the key factors that influenced the business of the company in that year, as well as a fair and unbiased overview of the company's past, present, and future.\n\nMD&A typically describes the corporation's liquidity position, capital resources,[8] results of its operations, underlying causes of material changes in financial statement items (such as asset impairment and restructuring charges), events of unusual or infrequent nature (such as mergers and acquisitions or share buybacks), positive and negative trends, effects of inflation, domestic and international market risks,[9] and significant uncertainties.\n\nMove to electronic statements\nFinancial statements have been created on paper for hundreds of years. The growth of the Web has seen more and more financial statements created in an electronic form which is exchangeable over the Web. Common forms of electronic financial statements are PDF and HTML. These types of electronic financial statements have their drawbacks in that it still takes a human to read the information in order to reuse the information contained in a financial statement.\n\nMore recently a market driven global standard, XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language), which can be used for creating financial statements in a structured and computer readable format, has become more popular as a format for creating financial statements. Many regulators around the world such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have mandated XBRL for the submission of financial information.\n\nThe UN/CEFACT created, with respect to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), internal or external financial reporting XML messages to be used between enterprises and their partners, such as private interested parties (e.g. bank) and public collecting bodies (e.g. taxation authorities).

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm's assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement. The total assets always equal the total combined liabilities and equity. This statement best demonstrates the basic accounting equation:\nAssets = Liabilities + Equity\n\nThe statement can be used to help show the financial position of a company because liability accounts are external claims on the firm's assets while equity accounts are internal claims on the firm's assets.\n\nAccounting standards often set out a general format that companies are expected to follow when presenting their balance sheets. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) normally require that companies report current assets and liabilities separately from non-current amounts.[5][6] A GAAP-compliant balance sheet must list assets and liabilities based on decreasing liquidity, from most liquid to least liquid. As a result, current assets/liabilities are listed first followed by non-current assets/liabilities. However, an IFRS-compliant balance sheet must list assets/liabilities based on increasing liquidity, from least liquid to most liquid. As a result, non-current assets/liabilities are listed first followed by current assets/liabilities.[7]\n\nCurrent assets are the most liquid assets of a firm, which are expected to be realized within a 12-month period. Current assets include:\n\ncash - physical money\naccounts receivable - revenues earned but not yet collected\nMerchandise inventory - consists of goods and services a firm currently owns until it ends up getting sold\nInvestee companies - expected to be held less than one financial period\nprepaid expenses - expenses paid for in advance for use during that year\nNon-current assets include fixed or long-term assets and intangible assets:\n\nfixed (long term) assets\nproperty\nbuilding\nequipment (such as factory machinery)\nintangible assets\ncopyrights\ntrademarks\npatents\ngoodwill\nLiabilities include:\n\ncurrent liabilities\ntrade accounts payable\ndividends payable\nemployee salaries payable\ninterest (e.g. on debt) payable\nlong term liabilities\nmortgage notes payable\nbonds payable\nOwner's equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner's equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.[8]\n\nStatement of retained earnings (statement of changes in equity)\nThis statement is additional to the three main statements described above. It shows how the distribution of income and transfer of dividends affects the wealth of shareholders in the company. The concept of retained earnings means profits of previous years that are accumulated till current period. Basic proforma for this statement is as follows:\n\nRetained earnings at the beginning of period\n\n+ Net Income for the period\n\n- Dividends\n\n= Retained earnings at the end of period.[9]\n\nBasic concepts\nThe stable measuring assumption\nOne of the basic principles in accounting is \"The Measuring Unit principle\":\n\nThe unit of measure in accounting shall be the base money unit of the most relevant currency. This principle also assumes the unit of measure is stable; that is, changes in its general purchasing power are not considered sufficiently important to require adjustments to the basic financial statements.\"[10]\n\nHistorical Cost Accounting, i.e., financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units, is based on the stable measuring unit assumption under which accountants simply assume that money, the monetary unit of measure, is perfectly stable in real value for the purpose of measuring (1) monetary items not inflation-indexed daily in terms of the Daily CPI and (2) constant real value non-monetary items not updated daily in terms of the Daily CPI during low and high inflation and deflation.\n\nUnits of constant purchasing power\nThe stable monetary unit assumption is not applied during hyperinflation. IFRS requires entities to implement capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in terms of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.\n\nFinancial accountants produce financial statements based on the accounting standards in a given jurisdiction. These standards may be the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of a respective country, which are typically issued by a national standard setter, or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nFinancial accounting serves the following purposes:\n\nproducing general purpose financial statements\nproducing information used by the management of a business entity for decision making, planning and performance evaluation\nproducing financial statements for meeting regulatory requirements.\nObjectives of financial accounting\nSystematic recording of transactions: basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions (i.e. book-keeping).

Your current ratio shouldn't fall far below 2:1. The better able you are to cover liabilities, the greater your ratio.\n\n2.   Debt-to-equity ratio\nA company's total debt is compared to its owners' equity using the debt-to-equity ratio. A company's balance sheet will contain both of these figures. Divide a company's total liabilities by its shareholder equity to determine its debt-to-equity ratio\n\n                             \tD/E ratio=  Total liabilities/ Shareholder equity\n\nIf a corporation has a debt-to-equity ratio of 2:1, it means that for every $1 invested in the company by shareholders, there are $2 in debt.

(Keep in mind that balance sheets represent moments in time.\n\nAs a result, the ending balance of the current period's inventory is equal to the balance at the beginning of the previous period's inventory.)\n\nYou divide a company's cost of sales, which appears on the income statement just below net revenues, by the average inventory for the time period to determine the inventory turnover ratio.\n\nInventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Sales / Average Inventory for the Period\n\nA company's inventory was turned over twice during the reporting period if its inventory turnover ratio was 2 to 1.\n\nExample\n\nThe average inventory value of a company was $100,000 last year, while its COGS was $300,000.

You divide a company's stock price by its earnings per share to determine its P/E ratio, or\n\nP/E Ratio = Price Per Share / Earnings Per Share\n\nExample\n\nThe P/E ratio of a corporation is 10 to 1 if its stock is trading at $30 per share and it earns $3 per share. The stock of the corporation is trading at 10 times earnings.\n\n7.      Current liability coverage ratio\nThe current liability coverage ratio reveals your current cash flow vs. the amount of debt you have coming due in the near future, usually within a year.\n\nYou must determine your current average obligation in order to utilize this formula. Calculating an average takes it into consideration so you can get an approximate number. Your current liability can fluctuate month to month as you pay down the principle on a debt.\n\nTo do this, sum up all of your current liabilities at the start and end of an accounting period, divide the total by 2, and you will have your current liabilities.\n\nHere\u2019s the formula for calculating your current average liability ratio:\n\nCurrent Average Liability Ratio =Net Cash from Operating Activities / Average Current Liabilities\n\nExample\n\nLet's assume that at the start of March and the end of March, a company's balance sheet showed total current liabilities of $900 and $800, respectively. And they made $100 from their working activity.\n\nHence current average liability= (900 + 800) / 2 = 850\n\nSo, their current average liability is $950.\n\nHere\u2019s calculating your current average liability ratio:\n\nFor the company, that would look like this:\n\nCurrent Average Liability Ratio = 100 / 850 = 0.12, or 12%\n\nA current liability coverage ratio of less than 1:1 indicates that the company's cash flow is insufficient to satisfy its immediate liabilities. In this instance, there is space for improvement for the company.\n\nLimitations of Financial Statements\nFinancial statements have limitations even if they offer a plethora of information about a company. Due to the statements' ambiguity, investors frequently come to quite diverse conclusions about a company's financial success.\n\nFor instance, some investors could prefer to see their money put in long-term assets, while other investors might favor stock repurchases. For one investor, a company's level of debt may be acceptable, while for another, it might raise concerns.\n\nIt's crucial to compare financial statements from different time periods to look for trends and to assess how the company's performance compares to that of its competitors in the same sector.\nLet's say that EXC Limited has $45,000 in current assets and $15,000 in current liabilities.

If a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb, like the one tested by North Korea in 2013, is dropped in Washington, DC, a fireball of almost 500 feet in radius will cover the city.2 The radiation will reach such high levels within a half a mile radius that 50-90% percent of people could die without medical help \u2013 some of them within hours.  \nWhen it comes to preventing WMD proliferation, we need to be conscious of both state and non-state actors. North Korea continues to procure sensitive goods for its nuclear and missile program in defiance of sanctions. Iran is procuring missile-related goods. Agents working on behalf of Syria have sought chemical goods on the commercial market. Several groups, such as Al Qaeda and ISIS, demonstrated interest in acquiring a WMD capability. We do not have a full picture of who might be interested in obtaining a WMD capability in the future.\nHow Proliferation Networks Operate\n\nStealing or buying a ready-made weapon is a next to impossible feat. The main path to a WMD is to procure components, material, and technology and then build a weapon. Because most goods usable in a WMD program are dual-use in nature, with indispensable civilian purposes, they are available on the international commercial market. \nThe international community attempts to minimize the risk that trade in dual-use and military goods entails. The international export control regimes and national export control systems are designed to regulate trade in sensitive items by requiring traders to obtain licenses. Additionally, the international and unilateral sanctions regimes target known proliferators.\nThe goal of proliferators and their agents is to acquire goods that can contribute to WMD programs without being caught. Proliferators and their networks continue to defy both export controls and sanctions.  \nProliferation networks come in all sizes and shapes. They can be small or large, loose, or more organized. Those buying WMD-related goods can be directly connected to proliferator states, or they can do it purely for profit by inserting themselves into the illicit market to make money.\nProliferators have perfected methods that help them stay under the radar.  One of the standard techniques they use is to buy goods that are slightly below the controlled threshold. This means that unless exporting companies are incredibly vigilant,4  they would not apply for an export license and subject transaction to government scrutiny. However, these slightly inferior goods can still be used for nefarious purposes.\nThere is another method proliferators use to avoid government oversight and licensing\u2014they pretend they are ordering goods for a domestic company. In such cases, supplier companies do not have to apply for licenses. \nTo avoid export controls and sanctions, proliferators lie about the end-use and end-user and hide behind front and shell companies all the time. They never declare that they are buying components for North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, Iran\u2019s missile program, or Syria\u2019s chemical arsenal. For example, they can tell a supplying company they need goods for scientific research or other peaceful purposes. In 2006, an Iranian company ordered sensitive bioresearch equipment from Norway purportedly for a scientific laboratory. On closer look, an attentive Norwegian supplier determined that the equipment Iranians sought was technically superior to what would be necessary for a civilian lab and that it did not fit the physical layout of the laboratory.\nIncreasingly, shipping companies and vessels are used prominently in sanction evasion. For example, Iran and North Korea falsify documents, reflag vessels, and switch off automatic identification systems to avoid being discovered in the process of illicit transfers of goods.6 \nSupplier companies that provide goods to proliferators can be complicit or not complicit. Larger companies have resources to implement strong internal compliance programs that help them detect any suspicious orders. But some companies, especially smaller ones, do not have resources to invest in compliance and remain negligent. In some cases, supplier companies or individuals within know precisely what they are doing. They do it either because of ideology (to support a sanctioned state) or for profit. In one notorious case, a U.S.-based company MKS Instruments sent pressure transducers to its subsidiary in China after duly applying for a U.S. export license, thinking that the goods would be used in China. The co-opted employee of the MKS Instruments\u2019 subsidiary ordered transducers from an unsuspecting parent company and pretended they would be used by Chinese companies but planned all along to ship those goods to Iran.  Pressure transducers can be used in uranium enrichment centrifuges, making possible the production of fissile material that can also be used in a nuclear weapon.\nProliferators prefer to buy good quality goods \u2013 mostly from the U.S., European, and Asian suppliers. This means that in most cases, they have to pay for those goods through the formal financial system, making financial institutions part of their proliferation schemes.\nCHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS \n\nProliferators use formal financial institutions for two main purposes: (1) to pay for procurement of WMD-related goods; (2) to fundraise, launder and move money associated with proliferation activity\u201d\nAnswer proliferators use formal financial institutions for what reason?\n1) To pay for procurement of WMD-related goods\n2) To fundraise, launder and move money associated with proliferation activity\n3) Both 1) and 2) are correct\n4) None of the Above"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "3) Both 1) and 2) are correct"}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}

The reasons for such a high number stem from the need of many different criminal organizations to \"clean\" and reintroduce \"dirty\" money into the global licit economic system. Furthermore, according to the figure mentioned above, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that annual losses of between 10-15% of the world GDP are calculated from this activity. International Anti-Money Laundering (AML) experts and the various financial supervisory authorities have suggested multiple sources linked to the international trade system behind this number.\n\n\n\nWhat is Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML)?\nA particular branch of the global anti-money laundering discipline has defined this system as Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML). The TBML consists of substance in the realization of money laundering through different methods \"based\" on international trade (exchange of goods, import, and export). The TBML system is based on the transfer and concealment of goods and money, justifying and certifying their false origin. As has been discovered, the goods are subsequently relocated to other systems, circuits, legal or illegal, so-called formal and informal. The TBML operates in all those situations where opportunities exist (or are purposely created) to circumvent the regulations on international trade (for example, the so-called tax havens). The subject matter of the TBML discipline involves a diversity of goods, from money (think of the IVTS - Informal Value Transfer System) to goods in general. It is not excluded that this discipline will also evolve towards so-called dematerialized goods; in general, this category includes any goods that can potentially generate an unlawful utility and profit.\n\nThe scope of the TBML is vast as many commercial sectors covered by the anti-money laundering legislation are based on the ability to meet and exchange goods between supply and demand. For example, the establishment and use of paper companies with the issuance of false - so-called non-existent - invoices or the use of methods such as over-invoicing (under-invoicing and multiple invoicing), the market for art and precious objects, the use of couriers and money remittances; in essence, all those transport, trade, and accounting operations are covered, which have as their thing buying and selling and which are demonstrated with false documents (excess in value and quantity).\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The criminal activities of Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) and Maritime Piracy cause significant financial damage to the licit economy annually.

This substantial figure represents between 10-15% of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Money laundering involves various criminal organizations seeking to \"clean\" and reintroduce illicit funds into the legitimate economic system.\n\nTrade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) specifically focuses on utilizing international trade methods, such as the exchange of goods through imports and exports, to facilitate money laundering activities. TBML operations involve the transfer and concealment of both goods and funds, often falsifying their origins to justify their legality. These goods are then moved to different legal and illegal systems, including formal and informal circuits, to further obfuscate their illicit nature. TBML thrives in situations where loopholes exist in international trade regulations, such as in tax havens.\n\nThe scope of TBML is extensive, encompassing various commercial sectors covered by anti-money laundering legislation. Techniques used in TBML include the establishment of paper companies issuing false invoices, manipulation of invoice values through methods like over-invoicing, and involvement in markets for art and precious objects. Additionally, TBML exploits transportation, trade, and accounting operations, utilizing falsified documents to facilitate illegal transactions.\n\nThe combined impact of TBML and Maritime Piracy presents a significant challenge to global financial stability and security, as these illicit activities undermine the integrity of the legitimate economic system and impede international trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}

Financial Identity Theft\nFinancial identity theft is perhaps the most common type of identity theft. It involves an unauthorized person gaining access to and using another person\u2019s financial information. The thief might open bank accounts, take out loans, or make transactions in the victim\u2019s name, causing financial havoc for the unsuspecting individual.\n\nProtecting your financial information is crucial to avoid this type of theft. Regularly review your bank and credit card statements for any suspicious activity. Consider adding a fraud alert or freeze on your credit reports, and use a reliable identity theft protection service like McAfee+.\n\n2. Medical Identity Theft\nMedical identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information to obtain medical care, buy drugs, or submit fake billings to your health insurer. This can lead to erroneous entries in your medical records and could potentially affect your health care or insurance coverage.\n\nBe vigilant about who has access to your medical records. Always verify the identity of anyone who requests your medical information. Moreover, review any medical bills or insurance statements carefully to ensure all information is accurate.\n\n3. Criminal Identity Theft\nCriminal identity theft occurs when someone commits a crime under your name. If they are arrested and provide your personal details, you may end up with a criminal record. You might also start receiving summonses for crimes you haven\u2019t committed, which can be frightening and confusing.\n\nTo protect against criminal identity theft, safeguard your personal information and monitor any changes to your public records. If you receive a summons or other legal notices for unfamiliar crimes, contact law enforcement immediately. Employing security measures through McAfee+ can also help you ward off potential risks.\n\n4. Synthetic Identity Theft\nSynthetic identity theft involves the creation of a new, fake identity using a combination of real and fabricated information. The thieves can then open fraudulent accounts and conduct illegal activities using this fake identity. It is more difficult to detect because the fraudulent activity doesn\u2019t show up on the victim\u2019s credit report.\n\nOne of the ways to avoid being a victim of synthetic identity theft is by shredding any physical documents that contain your personal information before discarding them. Online, consider using an identity protection service like McAfee+ to help ensure you\u2019re adequately protected.\n\n5. Child Identity Theft\nChild identity theft is when a thief uses a child\u2019s Social Security number to commit fraud. Since children generally have no credit history, this type of theft can go undetected for years. The identity thief can create a synthetic identity or open new credit accounts in the child\u2019s name.\n\nParents can protect their children from identity theft by not sharing their child\u2019s Social Security number unless absolutely necessary. It\u2019s also recommended to check if your child has a credit report close to their 16th birthday. If one exists, and your child has not been using credit, it could be an indication of identity theft.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The text outlines five common types of identity theft and provides tips on how to protect against each:\n\nFinancial Identity Theft: Unauthorized access to and use of another person\u2019s financial information, leading to fraudulent transactions.

If a 10-kiloton nuclear bomb, like the one tested by North Korea in 2013, is dropped in Washington, DC, a fireball of almost 500 feet in radius will cover the city.2 The radiation will reach such high levels within a half a mile radius that 50-90% percent of people could die without medical help \u2013 some of them within hours.  \n\nWhen it comes to preventing WMD proliferation, we need to be conscious of both state and non-state actors. North Korea continues to procure sensitive goods for its nuclear and missile program in defiance of sanctions. Iran is procuring missile-related goods. Agents working on behalf of Syria have sought chemical goods on the commercial market. Several groups, such as Al Qaeda and ISIS, demonstrated interest in acquiring a WMD capability. We do not have a full picture of who might be interested in obtaining a WMD capability in the future.\n\n2. How Proliferation Networks Operate\n\nStealing or buying a ready-made weapon is a next to impossible feat. The main path to a WMD is to procure components, material, and technology and then build a weapon. Because most goods usable in a WMD program are dual-use in nature, with indispensable civilian purposes, they are available on the international commercial market. \n\nThe international community attempts to minimize the risk that trade in dual-use and military goods entails. The international export control regimes and national export control systems are designed to regulate trade in sensitive items by requiring traders to obtain licenses. Additionally, the international and unilateral sanctions regimes target known proliferators.\n\nThe goal of proliferators and their agents is to acquire goods that can contribute to WMD programs without being caught. Proliferators and their networks continue to defy both export controls and sanctions.  \n\nProliferation networks come in all sizes and shapes. They can be small or large, loose, or more organized. Those buying WMD-related goods can be directly connected to proliferator states, or they can do it purely for profit by inserting themselves into the illicit market to make money.\n\nProliferators have perfected methods that help them stay under the radar.3  One of the standard techniques they use is to buy goods that are slightly below the controlled threshold. This means that unless exporting companies are incredibly vigilant,4  they would not apply for an export license and subject transaction to government scrutiny. However, these slightly inferior goods can still be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nThere is another method proliferators use to avoid government oversight and licensing\u2014they pretend they are ordering goods for a domestic company. In such cases, supplier companies do not have to apply for licenses. \n\nTo avoid export controls and sanctions, proliferators lie about the end-use and end-user and hide behind front and shell companies all the time. They never declare that they are buying components for North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, Iran\u2019s missile program, or Syria\u2019s chemical arsenal. For example, they can tell a supplying company they need goods for scientific research or other peaceful purposes. In 2006, an Iranian company ordered sensitive bioresearch equipment from Norway purportedly for a scientific laboratory. On closer look, an attentive Norwegian supplier determined that the equipment Iranians sought was technically superior to what would be necessary for a civilian lab and that it did not fit the physical layout of the laboratory.5 \n\nIncreasingly, shipping companies and vessels are used prominently in sanction evasion. For example, Iran and North Korea falsify documents, reflag vessels, and switch off automatic identification systems to avoid being discovered in the process of illicit transfers of goods.6 \n\nSupplier companies that provide goods to proliferators can be complicit or not complicit. Larger companies have resources to implement strong internal compliance programs that help them detect any suspicious orders. But some companies, especially smaller ones, do not have resources to invest in compliance and remain negligent. In some cases, supplier companies or individuals within know precisely what they are doing. They do it either because of ideology (to support a sanctioned state) or for profit. In one notorious case, a U.S.-based company MKS Instruments sent pressure transducers to its subsidiary in China after duly applying for a U.S. export license, thinking that the goods would be used in China. The co-opted employee of the MKS Instruments\u2019 subsidiary ordered transducers from an unsuspecting parent company and pretended they would be used by Chinese companies but planned all along to ship those goods to Iran.7  Pressure transducers can be used in uranium enrichment centrifuges, making possible the production of fissile material that can also be used in a nuclear weapon.\n\nProliferators prefer to buy good quality goods \u2013 mostly from the U.S., European, and Asian suppliers. This means that in most cases, they have to pay for those goods through the formal financial system, making financial institutions part of their proliferation schemes.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), including nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, pose a significant threat to both the United States and international security. The potential devastation from a nuclear detonation, such as the one tested by North Korea in 2013, underscores the urgent need for prevention and control measures.\n\nPreventing WMD proliferation requires vigilance against both state and non-state actors. North Korea, Iran, and agents acting on behalf of Syria continue to procure sensitive materials for their programs, often circumventing sanctions and export controls.\n\nProliferation networks operate through the procurement of dual-use materials and technologies, which have legitimate civilian applications. These networks vary in size and organization, employing methods to evade detection, such as purchasing goods below controlled thresholds or falsifying end-use declarations.\n\nShipping companies and vessels are increasingly utilized in sanction evasion efforts, with some supplier companies knowingly complicit in facilitating illicit transfers. Financial institutions may also unwittingly become involved in WMD proliferation schemes through the formal financial system. Overall, addressing WMD proliferation requires coordinated efforts to strengthen export controls, enforce sanctions, and enhance international cooperation to prevent the acquisition of materials and technologies necessary for WMD development.\n\n\n\n\n"}], "system": "You are a helpful financial assistant."}

The motives for perpetrating financial statement fraud include personal gain, keeping the business afloat, and retaining status as a leader in the organization. Fraudsters attempt to inflate the perceived worth of the company to make the stock appear more attractive to investors, to obtain bank approvals for loans and/or to justify large salaries and bonuses when compensation is tied to company performance.\n\nRegardless of the motive, financial statement fraud causes problems with current and potential investors and shareholders. It can result in large-scale reputational damage as well as serious sanctions from regulators \u2014 e.g., the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \u2014 and even arrests.\nKey Takeaways\nFinancial statement fraud is committed when people with access to financial documents and information manipulate data to make the company appear more successful.\nWarning signs for financial statement fraud are numerous and fall into four categories: financial, behavioral, organizational and business.\nTo detect fraud, have an auditor analyze the relationships between different financial numbers and compare the ratios to years past or industry norms.\nThe No. 1 way to prevent financial statement fraud is to have in place a system of strong internal controls that enforce the segregation of duties so that no single employee has authorization to view and alter all financial data.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "\"Every organization, big or small, strives to generate healthy returns and satisfy stakeholders. However, it is crucial to recognize that not all profits are created equal. In some cases, companies may resort to unethical practices or manipulations to artificially inflate their profits, presenting a dark side that can have severe consequences. In this section, we will delve into the various aspects of inflated profits, exploring the dangers they pose and shedding light on the potential pitfalls that businesses should be wary of.\n2. The Temptation of Watered Stock\nOne common method employed to inflate profits is through the use of watered stock. This refers to the practice of issuing shares at a value higher than their actual worth, creating an illusion of increased capital and subsequently boosting reported profits. By inflating the value of their stocks, companies can deceive investors and stakeholders into believing that the organization is performing better than it actually is. This unethical tactic not only misrepresents the financial health of a company but also undermines the trust of investors, leading to potential legal and reputational repercussions.\n3. Creative Accounting: The Art of Manipulation\nAnother avenue through which inflated profits can be achieved is through creative accounting techniques. While accounting practices should adhere to strict regulations and ethical standards, some companies manipulate financial statements to inflate their earnings artificially. One such method is revenue recognition manipulation, where companies recognize revenue prematurely or engage in aggressive revenue recognition practices, thereby inflating reported profits. Enron's infamous accounting scandal serves as a stark reminder of the devastating consequences that can arise from such deceptive practices.\n4. The dangers of Short-term Thinking\nInflated profits often stem from a short-term focus, where companies prioritize immediate gains over long-term sustainability. By engaging in unethical practices to boost profits, businesses may sacrifice future growth, customer trust, and employee morale. This short-term thinking can lead to a vicious cycle, where companies become increasingly reliant on inflated profits to maintain appearances, ultimately jeopardizing their long-term viability.\n5. The importance of transparency and Ethical Leadership\nTo combat the dark side of inflated profits, organizations must prioritize transparency and ethical leadership. By fostering a culture of honesty and integrity, businesses can mitigate the risk of succumbing to unethical practices. implementing robust internal controls, conducting regular audits, and adhering to stringent accounting standards are essential steps to ensure financial statements accurately reflect the company's true performance. Moreover, establishing a strong ethical framework and encouraging open communication within the organization can help prevent the temptation of inflating profits.\nInflated profits present a dangerous path that companies should avoid at all costs. The allure of short-term gains and the pressure to meet investor expectations can lead organizations down a treacherous road of unethical practices, compromising their long-term success and reputation. By understanding the various methods used to inflate profits and fostering a culture of transparency and ethical leadership, businesses can safeguard themselves against the dark side of inflated profits and pave the way for sustainable growth and prosperity.\"\n\nSummarize the over inflated revenue theory from the report and explain is there real evidence that companies might be exaggerating their revenues in annual report?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The report highlights the risks associated with inflated profits in businesses, emphasizing the potential consequences of unethical practices.

Furthermore, how can investors and regulators identify and address these issues in a timely manner to ensure the authenticity of annual reports and financial statements?\n\n\"Mr Kurniawan then sketched out a practice known as \u201cround tripping\u201d: a lump of money would leave the bank Wirecard owns in Germany, show its face on the balance sheet of a dormant subsidiary in Hong Kong, depart to sit momentarily in the books of an external \u201ccustomer\u201d, then travel back to Wirecard in India, where it would look to local auditors like legitimate business revenue.\u00a0\nIn isolation, Mr Kurniawan\u2019s scheme might have appeared to be the act of a rogue employee in the provincial outpost of a little known financial group. But the account of what happened, in a preliminary report on the investigation by one of\u00a0Asia\u2019s most eminent legal firms, indicated it was part of a pattern of book-padding across Wirecard\u2019s Asian operations over several years. Documents seen by the Financial Times show two senior executives in the Munich head office had at least some awareness of the round-tripping scheme: Thorsten Holten and Stephan von Erffa, respectively the company\u2019s head of treasury and head of accounting.\n\nThe revelations call into question the figures reported by one of Europe\u2019s few technological success stories, a German\u00a0fintech group that has grown into a \u20ac20bn global payments institution. Before the FT exposed the existence of\u00a0the investigation last week, the group was more valuable than\u00a0Deutsche Bank or\u00a0Commerzbank, whose place it has taken in Germany\u2019s main stock market index. Wirecard is a favourite of retail investors, who saw its rapid expansion into Asia as a sign that it can challenge the world\u2019s biggest banks for primacy in the $1.4tn market for payments.\u00a0\n\nMarkus Braun has run the company since helping to recapitalise it in 2002, an investment which made the 49-year-old Austrian a billionaire. In the field of digital money, Wirecard presents itself as best in class.\u00a0\n\nIn response to the news of the preliminary investigation, Wirecard initially said no material compliance findings had resulted. This week the company told the FT that while its investigation was ongoing, it had made no conclusive findings of criminal misconduct and it would be\u00a0wrong to draw conclusions from the preliminary report.\u00a0\nThis time questions about its Asian operations began internally, prompted by a whistleblower left stunned by Mr Kurniawan\u2019s January meeting last year. Notifying Wirecard\u2019s senior legal counsel in the region on March 26, the whistleblower identified two senior finance executives, James Wardhana and Irene Chai, as accomplices in the book-cooking operation.
